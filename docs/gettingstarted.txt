Getting started
===============

This document is designed to get you up and running with idios. This app is
designed for use with Django_, however, can be used with Pinax_. Pinax can
provide some extra components which will enhance the functionality of idios.
Those extra components are designed for Django too and Pinax simply brings
them together.


Prerequisites
=============

These are the requirements to run idios:

 * Python **2.4+** (Python 3.x is **not** supported yet)
 * Django **1.2+**


Installation
============

To install idios use pip_:

.. code-block:: none

    pip install idios

Add idios to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        "idios",
    ]

Hook up idios to your URLconf:

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns = patterns("",
        # ...
        url(r"^profiles/", include("idios.urls"))
    )

This is largely all you need to do to get idios setup in your project.
Continue reading on to learn more about how to use idios.


Usage
=====

To get Django to link ``User`` instances to their profile pages you can add
this bit to ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES = {
        "auth.user": lambda o: "/profiles/profile/%s/" % o.username,
    }

Now when you call ``get_absolute_url`` on any ``User`` instance it will
return the URL to that user's profile as configured above.

idios is designed to give you full control of the profile model. idios
provides a ``ProfileBase`` for your profile model to extend. To hook in your
profile model add this to your ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = "myapp.Profile"

This will additionally setup your profile model as the one Django's auth app
will use.

Where you put your profile model is entirely up to you. A common practice
we've used is either having a project specific app named ``profiles`` or named
after the project (we name all projects with ``_project`` suffix leaving the
first bit open for an app name).

Here is what how your profile model might look like:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    
    from idios.models import ProfileBase
    
    
    class Profile(ProfileBase):
        
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=20)

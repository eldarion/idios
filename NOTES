Notes on idios
==============


Projects using basic_profiles typically add the following to settings:

    ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES = {
        "auth.user": lambda o: "/profiles/profile/%s/" % o.username,
    }
    AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'basic_profiles.Profile'

It would be nice if the URL path wasn't hardcoded there, duplicating what's in
urls.py



Autocompleting user selection uses the separate autocomplete_app.
basic_profiles actually added these lines to urls.py:

url(r'^username_autocomplete/$', 'autocomplete_app.views.username_autocomplete_friends', name='profile_username_autocomplete'),
url(r'^username_autocomplete/$', 'autocomplete_app.views.username_autocomplete_all', name='profile_username_autocomplete'),
